Simple PCB Making With CNC 3018 from BANGGOOD 

As I wanted to Add a third extruder to my 3D printer , I had to build ( instead of buy LOL ), a Motor Stepper Expander for my RAMP 1.4 Board ( plugged to the Aux I/O of the Board.

The Board :
RAMP 1.4 From REPRAP ( https://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.4/fr )

The steppers controler :
A4988

The softwares :

PCB Design      => Sprint Layout 6

GCODE generator => https://carbide3d.com/apps/pcb/

GRBL Controler  => https://grbl-controller.software.informer.com/download/ ( Working on Linux With Wine )
